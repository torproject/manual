body:

The safest and simplest way to download Tor Browser is from the official Tor Project website at https://www.torproject.org/download.
Your connection to the site will be secured using [HTTPS](/secure-connections), which makes it much harder for somebody to tamper with.

However, there may be times when you cannot access the Tor Project website: for example, it could be blocked on your network.
If this happens, you can use one of the alternative download methods listed below.

### MIRRORS

If you're unable to download Tor Browser from the official Tor Project website, you can instead try downloading it from one of our official mirrors, either through [EFF](https://tor.eff.org), [Calyx Institute](https://tor.calyxinstitute.org) or [CCC](https://tor.ccc.de).

### GetTor

[GetTor](https://gettor.torproject.org/) is a service that automatically responds to messages with links to the latest version of Tor Browser, hosted at a variety of locations, such as Dropbox, Google Drive and GitHub.

### TO USE GETTOR VIA EMAIL:

Send an email to [gettor@torproject.org](mailto:gettor@torproject.org), and in the body of the message simply write “windows”, “osx”, or “linux”, (without quotation marks) depending on your operating system.
You can also add a language code to get Tor Browser on a language different than English.
For example, to get links for downloading Tor Browser in Chinese (China) for Windows, send an email to [gettor@torproject.org](mailto:gettor@torproject.org) with the words "windows zh_CN" in it.

GetTor will respond with an email containing links from which you can download the Tor Browser package, the cryptographic signature (needed for verifying the download), the fingerprint of the key used to make the signature, and the package’s checksum.
You may be offered a choice of “32-bit” or “64-bit” software: this depends on the model of the computer you are using.
