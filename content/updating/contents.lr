Tor Browser must be kept updated at all times. If you continue to use an outdated version of the software, you may be vulnerable to serious security flaws that compromise your privacy and anonymity.

Tor Browser will prompt you to update the software once a new version has been released: the Torbutton icon will display a yellow triangle, and you may see a written update indicator when Tor Browser opens. You can update either automatically or manually.

## UPDATING TOR BROWSER AUTOMATICALLY

When Tor Browser has finished checking for updates, click on the “Update” button.

Wait for the update to download and install, then restart Tor Browser. You will now be running the latest version.

## UPDATING TOR BROWSER MANUALLY

When you are prompted to update Tor Browser, finish the browsing session and close the program.

Remove Tor Browser from your system by deleting the folder that contains it (see the [Uninstalling](/uninstalling) section for more information).

Visit https://www.torproject.org/download/ and download a copy of the latest Tor Browser release, then install it as before.
