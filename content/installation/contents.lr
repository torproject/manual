For Windows:

4. When the download is complete, double click the `.exe` file. Complete the installation wizard process.


For macOS:

1. Navigate to the Tor Browser [download page](https://www.torproject.org/download).

2. Download the macOS `.dmg` file

3. (Recommended) Verify the [file's signature](https://support.torproject.org/en/tbb/how-to-verify-signature/).

4. When the download is complete, double click the `.dmg` file. Complete the installation wizard process.


For GNU/Linux:

1. Navigate to the Tor Browser [download page](https://www.torproject.org/download).

2. Download the GNU/Linux `.tar.xz` file

3. (Recommended) Verify the [file's signature](https://support.torproject.org/en/tbb/how-to-verify-signature/).

4. When the download is complete, extract the archive with the command `tar -xf [TB archive]` or by using an archive manager.

5. You'll need to tell your GNU/Linux that you want the ability to execute shell scripts from the graphical interface or the command line.
   Navigate to the newly extracted Tor Browser directory.
   Right click on `start-tor-browser.desktop`, open Properties or Preferences and change the permission to allow executing file as program.
   Double-click the icon to start up Tor Browser for the first time.

   **Note:** On Ubuntu and some other distros if you try to launch the start-tor-browser.desktop file a text file might open up.
To change this behavior and launch Tor Browser instead, follow this: Open "Files" (GNOME Files/Nautilus) → open Preferences → go to the 'Behavior' Tab → Select "Run them" or "Ask what to do" under "Executable Text Files".
If you choose the latter click on "Run" after launching the start-tor-browser.desktop file.

6. Alternatively, from inside the Tor Browser directory, you can also start from the command line by running:

   `./start-tor-browser.desktop`
